    <h3>All about Pilates</h3>

    <p>
      Pilates can improve muscle tone, flexibility and strength, as well as help
      you heal from injuries. If you haveve been looking for a new workout routine
      that can give you a good balance of flexibility, strength, muscle tone and
      help for a few aches and pains, Pilates may be the answer. It might look a
      bit intimidating at first, but it is much easier to get into ‚Äî and,
      depending on what you do, less expensive ‚Äî than you might assume. While
      Pilates has been around for nearly 100 years, it continues gaining
      traction, picking up new devotees all the time. Part of the reason it is
      become such a popular mode of exercise is that it is customizable to fit
      you and your health goals, regardless of your age, sex, health status and
      fitness level.
